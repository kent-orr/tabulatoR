# AGENTS Guidelines

- Use 4 spaces for indentation; avoid tabs.
- Prefer snake_case for functions and variables; R6 class names should use PascalCase.
- Document public functions with roxygen2 comments.
- Write commit messages in the imperative mood and keep them concise.
- Do not edit .Rd as these are automatically generated by Roxygen2.
- Do not use htmltools::JS, instead use the tabulatoR::js function

- when going to test, use pkgload::load_all() instead of installing devtools. 
- If you're going to run tests while coding, you should start with `R -e "install.packages(c('testthat', 'pkgload', 'htmltools', 'htmlwidgets'))"` for dependencies and work form there based on what errors.
