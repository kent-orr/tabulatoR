# AGENTS Guidelines

- Use 4 spaces for indentation; avoid tabs.
- Prefer snake_case for functions and variables; R6 class names should use PascalCase.
- Document public functions with roxygen2 comments.
- Write commit messages in the imperative mood and keep them concise.
- Do not edit .Rd as these are automatically generated by Roxygen2.
