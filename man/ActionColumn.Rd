in Shiny applications.
}
\details{
The \code{ActionColumn} function creates a column with a button in each cell. When the button
is clicked, it triggers a JavaScript action that can interact with Shiny inputs. The action
is defined by the \code{action} parameter, which is inserted into the JavaScript code.
JavaScript callbacks must be wrapped using \code{js()} from this package to be
interpreted as executable functions in the browser.
