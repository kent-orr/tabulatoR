\arguments{
\item{expr}{A reactive expression that returns a \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix}.}

\item{editable}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), cells can be edited.}

\item{columnDefinition}{A list defining default properties for all columns.
For example, \code{list(editor = "input", validator = "numeric")}.
See \url{https://tabulator.info/docs/6.3/columns} for all column options.}

\item{selectableRange}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, enables range selection with mouse/keyboard.
See \url{https://tabulator.info/docs/6.3/select#range}}

\item{clipboardPasteAction}{Character. Action to take when pasting data. Options:
"replace" (default) or "update".
See \url{https://tabulator.info/docs/6.3/clipboard}}

\item{events}{A named list of JS events that should be sent back to Shiny as input values.
See \url{https://tabulator.info/docs/6.3/events} for all available events.}

\item{options}{A named list of additional Tabulator options to customize the spreadsheet.
All Tabulator configuration options are supported.
See \url{https://tabulator.info/docs/6.3/options}}

\item{...}{Additional named elements to include in the payload passed to the front-end.}

\item{.opts}{A named list of additional payload entries, useful for programmatic inclusion.
Elements in \code{...} will override matching keys in \code{.opts}.}

\item{env}{The environment in which to evaluate \code{expr}.}

\item{quoted}{Logical. Is \code{expr} already quoted? If not, it will be quoted.}
}
\value{
A function that returns a list to be serialized and passed to the Tabulator output binding.

\description{
Creates a reactive Tabulator spreadsheet widget for use in Shiny applications.
Spreadsheet mode provides an Excel-like interface with grid-based editing,
arrow key navigation, and clipboard support.

This function uses column definitions to provide real column headers from your
data.frame or matrix column names, rather than generic A, B, C labels. Data is
stored as objects (named lists) which allows for field-based access and simpler
CRUD operations.

This is a thin wrapper around Tabulator's spreadsheet mode. For complete documentation
of all available options and features, see the official Tabulator documentation:
\url{https://tabulator.info/docs/6.3/spreadsheet}
}
\details{
Spreadsheet mode differs from standard table mode in several ways:
\itemize{
\item Column headers display actual data.frame/matrix column names
\item Data is stored as objects with field names for easier access
\item \strong{Double-click} a cell to enter edit mode (or press Enter)
\item Use \strong{arrow keys} to navigate between cells
\item Press \strong{Tab} to move to the next cell
\item Built-in support for copy/paste operations (Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V)
\item Cannot use features like pagination, grouping, or tree structures
}

The \code{editTriggerEvent} is set to "dblclick" by default for smoother navigation.
This allows you to click cells to select them and use arrow keys to navigate
without accidentally entering edit mode.

JavaScript callbacks (such as event handlers) must be wrapped using \code{js()}
from this package to be interpreted as executable functions in the browser.
